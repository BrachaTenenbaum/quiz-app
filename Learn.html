              <p id= "blurb-1" title= "Intro"> The Flathead Indian Reservation, located in western Montana, is home to the Bitterroot Salish, Kootenai, and Pend d'Oreilles Tribes - also known as the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation. The Bitteroot Salish came from the West Coast, whereas the Kootenai lived mostly in the interior of present-day Idaho, Montana, and Canada. During the 18th century, the Salish and the Kootenai tribes shared gathering and hunting grounds. As European-American settlers entered the area, the peoples came into conflict.

            <p id= "blurb-2" title="Smallpox Outbreak"> In the 1780's a smallpox outbreak reached a group of Salish camped in the Missoula area. The camp divided families with smallpox and those without. One group went to the Bitterroot Valley while the other moved to the Drummond area. Only one boy in the Bitterroot camp survived the epidemic. By 1782, small pox had killed an estimated one-half to three-quarters of the Salish and Pend d’ Oreille bands. The combination of the introduction of disease, firearms and horses led to massive changes in intertribal territories. Blackfeet expansion caused eastern bands of the Salish and Pend d’ Oreille to move their winter camps west of the continental divide. The Salishian people called the Tun áxn, who occupied the Rocky Mountain front, were decimated. The survivors scattered to the west and merged with other tribes, bringing about the near extinction of a native people.

            <p id= "blurb-3" title="Fur Trade">In 1803, through the Louisiana Purchase, the United States purchased from France the right to be the only purchaser of tribal lands when and if Indians ever chose to sell any land, and, the sovereign and commercial rights to be the only government to trade and engage in diplomatic relationships with the tribal nations in the Louisiana Territory. Two years later in 1805, the Salish allowed Lewis and Clark to enter Salish territory in the Bitterroot Valley near Darby, opening the door to fur trade and firearms in Salish territory.

            <p id= "blurb-4" title="Treaty of Hellgate">In 1855 Tribal leaders and U.S. officials signed the Treaty of Hell Gate. Under terms of the treaty, tribal leaders ceded to the U.S. “title” to the vast majority of their lands west of the continental divide. Tribal leaders reserved 1.25 million acres for the Flathead Reservation, along with the “Conditional Bitterroot Reservation” for what the treaty said was to be for the tribes “exclusive use and benefit.” In the treaty, the tribes also reserved rights on their ceded lands, including the right to hunt, fish, gather plants, and pasture livestock on “open and unclaimed lands.” Tribal understanding of the boundaries of the Flathead Reservation was considerably different from what was actually written in the treaty, particularly, the east, west and northern boundaries.

            <p id= "blurb-5" title="Salish leave the Bitteroot Valley"> Just two years after the Treaty of Hell Gate was signed, in 1872, Representative Garfield met with the Salish near present-day Stevensville to secure their approval and signature on an agreement for their removal to the Jocko Reservation. Chief Charlo refused to sign. Under the terms of the agreement, the Salish were to move from the Bitterroot Valley to the Jocko Reservation (Flathead Reservation) in exchange for $55,000, new log houses, a side of beef for every family, and plots of land designated specifically for the Salish. Salish sub-chiefs Arlee and Adolph signed the contract, but head chief Charlo, son of Victor, refused to sign, therefore making the contract invalid. When the agreement was officially presented upon Garfield’s return, a signature mark, which was a forgery, appeared on the contract by Chief Charlo’s typed name. Chief Charlo was enraged when he found out about this deception. The senate approved the agreement for ratification.

            <p id= "blurb-6" title="Trickery and Loss">In 1904 congress passed the Flathead Allotment Act, setting the course for the loss of over 60% of the reservation land base. Heads of household were assigned 160 acres, while single adults received 80 acres. Two rounds of allotments were held. An enrollment and census were done to assign allotments. At this time, many names were altered, as the census workers insisted on each individual having two names. Upon completion of the census, 2,390 tribal members were eligible to receive allotments. Of the 1,245,000 acres, only 245,000 acres were secured by allotments. The remaining grazing and agricultural lands were opened up to homesteading. Amendments to the act seized additional lands for town sites, the Indian agency, churches, reservoirs, power sites, and 61,000 acres for Montana school lands. After 2,400 allotments were issued, covering jsut 228,434 acres, the remaining land was declared “surplus.” “Surplus” reservation lands were sold to homesteaders. In 1908 the Flathead Irrigation Project bill passed, justified as aiding Indians in transition to agriculture. The project actually benefited non-Indian farmers and ranchers, and harmed many native subsistence operations. Many Indians lacked the money to pay the irrigation charges, which led to allotments being seized for settlement of debts. At its core, the Flathead Allotment Act was a breach of the 1855 Treaty of Hell Gate and steps were taken 60 years later to rectify the breach.

            <p id= "blurb-7" title="Legal Jurisdiction"> In 1961 the tribes entered into a Public Law agreement with the state of Montana. This law allowed the state to assume criminal and civil jurisdiction on the reservation. The law was amended between 1953 and 1968, allowing states to assume jurisdiction unilaterally. In response, after tribal opposition, Congress amended the law to include a requirement for tribal consent for the jurisdiction change, and also to allow acceptance of “retrocession” of the state’s assumption of jurisdiction. In 1963 the state of Montana passed legislation to allow the state to assume jurisdiction on reservations. However, by this time the law had been amended to require tribal consent. The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes were the only tribe in the state to agree to PL 83-280. In 1965 the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes passed a Tribal Ordinance defining the terms under which they would come under PL 83-280.

            <p id= "blurb-8" title="Steps to Repair the Damage"> In 1971, the U.S. Court of Claims found that the Flathead Allotment Act was a breach of the 1855 Treaty of Hell Gate. Compensation to the Tribes was determined in 1912 land values, totaling $7,410,000, of which only $1,783,549 had been paid. The balance of $5,626,451 was paid a few years later. However, a lot of land still legaly owned by whites. In recent years, the tribe has made a effort to buy back land and to reach it's original ownership from the Treaty of Hell Gate. The maps below the transition of land ownershipt since the Treaty of Hell Gate to present day.
